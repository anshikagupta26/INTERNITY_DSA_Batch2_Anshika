Day - 1 Task

Q1. What is data?
A1. Data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing.

Q2. What is data structures?
A2. Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
  There are two types of data structures:

  ->Primitive data structure
     ->The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.
  ->Non-primitive data structure
    ->Linear data structure
      a. Arrays
      b. Linked List
      c. Stacks
      d. Queues
    ->Non-linear data structure
      a. Trees
      b. Graph
 
Q3. What is abstract data types?
A3. The abstract datatype is special kind of datatype, whose behavior is defined by a set of values and set of operations.The ADT is made of with primitive datatypes, but operation logics are hidden.
	for example stack ADT.

Q4. Need of Data Structures in real life.
A4. To implement printer spooler so that jobs can be printed in the order of their arrival. To implement back functionality in the internet browser. To store the possible moves in a chess game. To store a set of Ô¨Åxed key words which are referenced very frequently.

Q5. Revise the concepts of C++.
A5. Revised.

Q6. Explore more about Standard Template Library(STL).
A6. The Standard Template Library (STL) is a software library for the C++ programming language that influenced many parts of the C++ Standard Library. It provides four components called algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators.
